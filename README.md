### Local
###### Before you set out to buy your next textbook, we invite you to use our website to check if someone from your local campus has listed that particular textbook for sale. Simply search for the textbook by name, author or isbn number; if you find it, great! You can go ahead and purchase it online and have it delivered to you within the next two days.

### Simple
###### If you are looking to sell your textbook locally, our platform provides a simple three step procedure: search for the textbook's isbn number, insert your price, connect to a stripe account (if it is your first listing), done. Once your textbook is sold, our logistics team takes care of the pick-up and delivery of your textbook.
### Secure
###### All sellers on our platform are required to have a stripe account. This process takes about a minute; we pre-filled the sign up form for your convenience. By using stripe's payment system we are able to provide a secure means of buying a textbook and a simple and quick means of receiving payment for a textbook.

#### Upcoming Feature
###### Ability for sellers to print shipping labels upon the purchase of their book. Might contribute to https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyusps to extend its functionality to include shipping label functionalities.
