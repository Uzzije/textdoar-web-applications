        <h3>
            Q: How do I know my payments are secure?

        </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            A: All payments through textdoar go through Stripe, a financial technology company that allows both
            private individuals and businesses to accept payments over the Internet. They also handle payments for
            companies such as Lyft and Squarspace. We do not store your sensitive payment information on our server's either.
            This means that in the rare occasion that our secured systems get breached your information will be safe.

            Q: I sold my book, it has been picked up, when do I receive my money?

        </h3>

        <p>
            A: All payments will be deposited into the sellers’ bank account two days after the book is picked up from the sellers’ house.

                 Q: Can anyone use this website?

        </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            A: No! Each buyer and seller must be a student here in Manhattan, Kansas or one who still has a valid edu email, i.e a recent graduate.

            Q: When will this be at my University?
