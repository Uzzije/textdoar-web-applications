                <p>Textdoar is a textbook-sharing platform designed to provide college students with affordable
                and reliable textbooks in the most convenient way possible. We are currently in test phase,
                hence serving only K-State and other local schools in the manhattan area.</p>
                <p>Textdoar pride itself in it unique pick up and delivery system that allows the most optimal
                convenience for sellers and buyers. When a studentsâ€™ textbook sells on textdoar.com, he or she will
                leave the textbook in a specific location determined by their residence status. For example, if the student
                resides in a house he or she will be able to leave the book in their mailbox or their front steps for a
                textdoar driver to pick up.</p>
                <p>
                As a really young company, the textdoar team members spend their day learning to serve the local student
                communities through the user's experience of it's online platform and logistic service. </p>
